Program files:
prog.c
output.c//This is the file outputed by prog.c

To compile and run the code, type in :
gcc -o prog prog.c
./prog output.c
where output.c is an empty c file as output for prog.c
Then, compile the output file :
gcc -o output output.c
./output number
where number is the population of a particular region you live in.

What my code does in general:
When open prog.c, make sure the horizontal length is equal or more than 115,
and then you can see the white space as the shape of a water facet. This code
outputs another piece of code in the shape of a drop of water, (ideally it
should be smooth, but due to limitation of number of chars, it's kind of
discrete). And to run the output.c with population, it tells you how much water
the population of a region can save anually if everyone work to save 1 liter of
water each day. The idea is that the original code prog.c is a facet and it
produces the output.c code, as a drop of water, that tells people how much water
(resources) we can save by just starting from small amounts.
