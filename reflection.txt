Reflection on assignment9

This assignment is very open ended and it took me some time to decide between the CO2
choice and obfuscated c, and it also took me some time to decide what to do with
obfuscated c. It took me a lot of time to format the output code into the shape of
a drop of water (as close as possible), because the curve is nonlinear and I tried
several ways to do it. I ended up with a shape kind of similar but not smooth enough
because certain keywords can't be separated from middle. Also some of the way to shape
this code is not super well written into a generic way, but rather hard coded. The idea
does not involve much sophisticated knowledge that we learned, for instance, bit
manipulation or even structs, but was pretty tedious to achieve. I think the good part
is that it's fun to look at.
